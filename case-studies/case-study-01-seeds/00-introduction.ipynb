The `02-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb` notebook is the second phase of the Case Study and contains the **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) work.

    "The reader will note that the work in this Case Study has been split across three notebooks. While it is possible to do the work in this Case Study in a single notebook, we will consider it a best practice to use multiple notebooks and to do so to help to structure the work. Each notebook will represent a major phase of the work, while minor phases of work will be designated with subheadings within a specific notebook. This helps with computing resources, especially the execution of JavaScript required to render a Jupyter Notebook, but also with referring to earlier work in later phases of a project."
